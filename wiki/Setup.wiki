In order to build your own FiveWeb apps, you need to use Harbour. If you are using a Windows based server, then use Harbour for Windows:

if you plan to use a Linux server, then use Harbour for Linux:

FiveWeb provides a makefile for Windows and another for Linux. In the samples folder there is a build.bat for Windows and a build.sh for Linux

If using Linux then remember to change the app permissions to make it executable:

chmod 755 myapp
